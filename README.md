# Advent of Code 2022

These are my solutions to the [Advent of Code 2022](https://adventofcode.com/2022) puzzles. These solutions aren't great, but they're mine, so that's something.

These are starting out in Rust, because I'm not very good at Rust.

## Getting Started

`cargo run -rq [day] [puzzle] [type]`

- `[day]` is one of `day-1 | day-2 | ...`
- `[puzzle]` is one of `puzzle-1 | puzzle-2`
- `[type]` is one of `sample | puzzle`, where `sample` runs with the sample input, and `puzzle` runs with the puzzle input
